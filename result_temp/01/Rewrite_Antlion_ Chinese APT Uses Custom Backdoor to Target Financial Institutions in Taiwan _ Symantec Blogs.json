  "Reconnaissance": "None",
  "Resource Development": "None",
  "Initial Access": "The Antlion APT group, attributed to Chinese state-backed actors, targeted financial institutions in Taiwan, leveraging a custom backdoor named xPack for initial access. The xPack backdoor, a .NET loader, decrypts and executes .bin files, and was used to execute system commands, drop subsequent malware, and stage data for exfiltration. The attackers also utilized the MSSQL service to execute system commands, indicating a likely exploitation of a web application or service for initial access. Additionally, Antlion has previously used malicious emails for initial network penetration.",
  "Execution": "The Antlion APT group executed malicious code using a variety of methods. They ran WMI commands remotely and leveraged EternalBlue exploits within the xPack backdoor. The attackers interacted with SMB shares, possibly using them to transfer files from their infrastructure. They also browsed the web through the backdoor, likely as a proxy. Off-the-shelf tools like PowerShell, WMIC, ProcDump, LSASS, and PsExec were used, as well as legitimate AnyDesk software for remote access. Exploits such as CVE-2019-1458 were leveraged for privilege escalation and remote scheduled tasks to execute their backdoor.",
  "Persistence": "The Antlion APT group maintained persistence on victim networks for extended periods, up to 250 days in one case. They deployed both custom and off-the-shelf malware to maintain their foothold.",
  "Privilege Escalation": "Antlion exploited CVE-2019-1458, an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in Windows, to gain higher-level permissions on compromised systems.",
  "Defense Evasion": "Antlion employed various defense evasion techniques, including the use of legitimate versions of WinRAR for data exfiltration and PowerShell's BitsTransfer module to upload data to their infrastructure. They likely automated data collection via batch scripts and staged data for further exfiltration without actual network transmission.",
  "Credential Access": "Antlion engaged in credential dumping using WMIC to execute commands that saved registry hives containing credential information. They also used a custom keylogger and tools like Mimikatz to obtain credentials.",
  "Discovery": "Antlion conducted extensive discovery activities on compromised networks. They used WMIC to collect system information and list processes, and executed commands to query user sessions, list running processes, and directory contents. They also collected account, group, and workstation configuration information.",
  "Lateral Movement": "None",
  "Collection": "Antlion collected data of interest, including information from software related to business contacts, investments, and smart card readers. They used batch scripts to automate data collection and staged data for exfiltration.",
  "Command and Control": "None",
  "Exfiltration": "Antlion exfiltrated data using PowerShell and legitimate software like WinRAR. They initiated uploads to their infrastructure and staged data for exfiltration, indicating espionage as the campaign's goal.",
  "Impact": "None",
  "Others": "None"
