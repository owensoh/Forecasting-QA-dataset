  "Initial Access": "On February 24, 2022, Proofpoint detected an email from a ukr[.]net address sent to a European government entity. The email's subject was 'IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF UKRAINE DATED 24.02.2022' and included a macro-enabled XLS file titled 'list of persons.xlsx,' which was designed to deliver SunSeed malware.",
  "Execution": "The malicious XLS attachment contained a VB macro named 'Module1' that created a Windows Installer object to call out to an actor-controlled staging IP and download a malicious MSI package. The macro set the UILevel to '2' for a silent installation, hiding actions and network connections from the user.",
  "Persistence": "The MSI package installed legitimate Lua dependencies, a modified Windows Lua interpreter, a malicious Lua script named SunSeed, and established persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at Windows Startup.",
  "Privilege Escalation": "None",
  "Defense Evasion": "The MSI package used for SunSeed malware installation utilized the Japanese Shift-JIS code base, potentially as a false flag. The package was created using an outdated version of WiX Toolset version 3.11.0.1528, and the legitimate Windows Lua interpreter sppsvc.exe was modified to suppress console output.",
  "Credential Access": "None",
  "Discovery": "None",
  "Lateral Movement": "None",
  "Collection": "None",
  "Command and Control": "The SunSeed malware issued GET requests over HTTP via port 80 using a Lua Socket to the C2 server every three seconds, appending the infected target's C Drive partition serial number to the URI request.",
  "Exfiltration": "None",
  "Impact": "None",
  "Others": "Proofpoint identified a phishing campaign likely sponsored by a nation-state, using a possibly compromised Ukrainian armed service member's email account to target European government personnel involved in refugee logistics. The campaign is similar to activity observed in July 2021, suggesting the same threat actor, tracked as part of TA445, is behind both. The campaign's focus on European government personnel managing refugee movement aligns with TA445's tactics, including disinformation operations to manipulate European sentiment around refugees. The campaign may be part of a hybrid warfare model employed by the Russian military and Belarus, aiming to gather intelligence and potentially exploit refugee movements for disinformation purposes."
