  "Reconnaissance": "Proofpoint researchers have identified a phishing campaign originating from an email address (ukr[.]net) that appears to belong to a compromised Ukrainian armed service member. The email included a malicious macro attachment which attempted to download a Lua-based malware dubbed SunSeed. The infection chain used in this campaign bears significant similarities to a historic campaign Proofpoint observed in July 2021, making it likely the same threat actor is behind both clusters of activity. The email targeted European government personnel involved in managing the logistics of refugees fleeing Ukraine.",
  "Resource Development": "None",
  "Initial Access": "None",
  "Execution": "The malicious XLS attachment observed in the email was laden with a simple but distinct macro. When enabled, it executes a VB macro named âModule1â which creates a Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) object invoking Windows Installer to call out to an actor-controlled staging IP and download a malicious MSI package. It also sets a Microsoft document UILevel equal to â2â which specifies a user interface level of completely silent installation. The actor accesses the delivery IP via the Microsoft Installer InstallProduct method which is intended to obtain an MSI install file from a URL, save it to a cached location, and finally begin installation of the MSI package. The package installs 12 legitimate Lua dependencies, a Windows Lua interpreter, a malicious Lua script (SunSeed), and a Windows shortcut LNK file for persistence. The actor utilized the Japanese Shift-JIS code base, resulting in a Japanese language installation message upon launching the MSI package. Additionally, examination of the cryptography calls made by the package during installation indicates that the MSI file appears to have been created using a dated version of WiX Toolset version 3.11.0.1528.",
  "Persistence": "The SunSeed malware when executed issues GET requests over HTTP via port 80 using a Lua Socket. The requests are issued to the C2 server every three seconds anticipating a response. The malware specifies the user agent as âLuaSocket 2.0.2â and appends the infected targetâs C Drive partition serial number to the URI request. This is a unique decimal digit value assigned to a drive upon creation of the file system. It may be an attempt by actors to track infected victims on the backend per their unique serial number. Additionally, this may allow operators to be selective about which infections are issued an ext stage payload response.",
  "Privilege Escalation": "None",

  "Credential Access": "None",
  "Discovery": "The Proofpoint-observed email messages were limited to European governmental entities. The targeted individuals possessed a range of expertise and professional responsibilities. However, there was a clear preference for targeting individuals with responsibilities related to transportation, financial and budget allocation, administration, and population movement within Europe.",

  "Impact": "This activity, independent of attribution conclusions, represents an effort to target NATO entities with compromised Ukrainian military accounts during an active period of armed conflict between Russia, its proxies, and Ukraine. In publishing this report, Proofpoint seeks to balance the accuracy of responsible reporting with the quickest possible disclosure of actionable intelligence. The onset of hybrid conflict, including within the cyber domain, has accelerated the pace of operations and reduced the amount of time that defenders have to answer deeper questions around attribution and historical correlation to known nation-state operators. However, these are issues that Proofpoint will continue to research while protecting customers globally. Proofpoint invites additional details and input around any observed activity that aligns with these reports. While the utilized techniques in this campaign are not groundbreaking individually, if deployed collectively, and during a high tempo conflict, they possess the capability to be quite effective. As the conflict continues, researchers assess similar attacks against governmental entities in NATO countries are likely. Additionally, the possibility of exploiting intelligence around refugee movements in Europe for disinformation purposes is a proven part of Russian and Belarussian-state techniques. Being aware of this threat and disclosing it publicly are paramount for cultivating awareness among targeted entities."
