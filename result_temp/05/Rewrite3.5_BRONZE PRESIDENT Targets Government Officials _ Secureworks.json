  "Execution": "The report contains detailed information about the Execution tactic, including the use of PlugX malware to compromise government officials' computers in several countries. The malware is embedded within RAR archive files and is executed when the recipient clicks on a Windows shortcut file. The payload sets up persistence on the host by setting a registry Run key and executes the copy of the legitimate file under ProgramData, passing it a command-line argument before exiting. The payload resolves various required Windows functions and starts a new thread that makes repeated calls to CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent, exiting if it detects a debugger. The malicious DLLs and payloads are heavily obfuscated to hinder analysis and reduce the likelihood of detection by host-based security software.",
