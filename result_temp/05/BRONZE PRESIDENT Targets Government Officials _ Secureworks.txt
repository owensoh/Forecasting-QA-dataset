BRONZE PRESIDENT Targets Government Officials

The likely Chinese government-sponsored threat group uses decoy documents and PlugXmalware to compromise targets. Thursday, September 8, 2022 By: Counter Threat UnitResearch TeamIn June and July 2022, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers identified aPlugX malware campaign targeting computers belonging to government officials of severalcountries in Europe, the Middle East, and South America. PlugX is modular malware thatcontacts a command and control (C2) server for tasking and can download additional pluginsto enhance its capability beyond basic information gathering. Several characteristics of thiscampaign indicate that it was conducted by the likely Chinese government-sponsoredBRONZE PRESIDENT threat group, including the use of PlugX, file paths and namingschemes previously used by the threat group, the presence of shellcode in executable fileheaders, and politically-themed decoy documents that align with regions where China hasinterests.

The malware is embedded within RAR archive files. Opening the archive on a Windowscomputer with default settings displays a Windows shortcut (LNK) file (see Figure 1) thatmasquerades as a document.

Alongside the shortcut is a hidden folder that contains the malware, embedded eight levelsdeep in a sequence of hidden folders named with special characters (see Figure 2). Thistiering is likely to bypass mail-scanning products that may not traverse the entire path whenscanning content, suggesting that the delivery mechanism was phishing emails, as there is noother benefit to creating such a folder structure.

To execute the malware, the recipient must click the Windows shortcut file. The shortcutexecutes a renamed legitimate file contained in the eighth hidden folder. Alongside thelegitimate file is a malicious DLL and an encrypted payload file. CTU™ researchers observedthe malicious payload using the folder names and filenames in Table 1.

Table 1. Filenames used in PlugX campaign.

The legitimate binary files are vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking. When executed, theyimport the malicious DLL that loads, decrypts, and executes the payload file. In each sampleanalyzed by CTU researchers, the shortcut file metadata indicates the file was created on aWindows system either with hostname "desktop-n2v1smh" or "desktop-cb248vr".

Once running, the payload drops a decoy document to the logged-on user's %Temp%directory and copies the three files to a ProgramData subdirectory using the pattern "<Application><3 characters>" (e.g., Operavng) (see Figure 3). This naming scheme has beenused in previous BRONZE PRESIDENT PlugX campaigns. CTU researchers observed thatwhen the payload performs the copy operation, it names the legitimate executable with itsusual name (e.g., Opera.exe, AdobePlugin.exe, AvastBrowser.exe).

The political nature of the decoy documents suggests that the government officials of variouscountries are targets for BRONZE PRESIDENT's intelligence collection efforts (see Figures 4,5, and 6). The threat group consistently targets China's neighbors such as Myanmar andVietnam. However, its collection requirements can change quickly and are often driven bygeopolitical events such as the war in Ukraine.

PlugX sets up persistence on the host by setting a registry Run key (see Figure 7).

Figure 7. PlugX registry configuration. (Source: Secureworks)

The running instance of the PlugX payload executes the copy of the legitimate file underProgramData, passing it a command-line argument before exiting (see Figure 8). Passingcommand-line arguments lets the malware adapt its execution based on its executionlocation. CTU researchers observed this tactic in previous BRONZE PRESIDENT PlugXcampaigns. Once running, the legitimate file again imports the malicious DLL in the samefolder, loading, decoding, and passing execution to the malicious payload file.

Figure 8. PlugX process execution with command-line argument. (Source: Secureworks)

BRONZE PRESIDENT Targets Government Ofﬁcials | Secureworks

The payload file calls GetCommandLineW to check the number of arguments. If an additionalargument follows the file path, the malware opens the decoy document previously dropped tothe user's %Temp% folder and continues execution with its C2 routine.

The malicious DLLs and payloads are heavily obfuscated to hinder analysis and to reduce thelikelihood of detection by host-based security software. The malicious DLL executes itspayload using an unusual technique. Instead of using a call or jmp instruction, it first decodesand copies the payload to a new allocation of memory and then makes a call toEnumThreadWindows to pass execution to the start of the malicious payload file (see Figure9).

Figure 9. Malicious DLL calling EnumThreadWindows. (Source: Secureworks)

The start of the payload file is treated as executable code in the same way as a Cobalt Strikestageless payload artifact. This could be a tactic developed by BRONZE PRESIDENT toincrease the likelihood of its malware being misidentified as the popular Cobalt Strike tool.

The payload resolves various required Windows functions. It then starts a new thread thatmakes repeated calls to CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent, exiting if it detects a debugger.

Figure 10 shows the payload preparing to decode its configuration. The values pushed to thestack are key length, key, data length, and data address. The key is used as a multibyte XORvalue. All observed key value lengths are nine bytes, and their values vary across samples.

Figure 11 shows the beginning of the decoded configuration, including the installationdirectory, mutex name, and the name of the decoy document associated with the sample.

BRONZE PRESIDENT has demonstrated an ability to pivot quickly for new intelligencecollection opportunities. Organizations in geographic regions of interest to China shouldclosely monitor this group's activities, especially organizations associated with or operating asgovernment agencies.

To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations useavailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 2. Note thatIP addresses can be reallocated. The IP addresses may contain malicious content, so considerthe risks before opening them in a browser.
