{
  "Reconnaissance": "The StellarParticle campaign involved extensive reconnaissance activities, including the theft of browser cookies for bypassing multifactor authentication, credential hopping for obscuring lateral movement, and access to internal knowledge repositories such as wikis. The threat actor also probed external services, attempted to remotely list running processes on systems, and used FTP scanning to gain knowledge about the victim's environment.",
  "Resource Development": "The campaign involved the establishment of persistence through VPN access, the theft of browser cookies, and the creation of new O365 Service Principals with broad access permissions. The threat actor also deployed several layers of persistence utilizing both pre-existing and attacker-created Service Principals to gain global access to email.",
  "Initial Access": "The threat actor gained initial access to victim systems through the use of local accounts for SSH tunneling, VPN access, and the theft of browser cookies for bypassing multifactor authentication. They also attempted to regain access by probing external services and using FTP scanning to identify misconfigured accounts with shell access.",
  "Execution": "The threat actor executed various commands and scripts, including credential theft using Get-ADReplAccount, in-memory Mimikatz commands, and the use of AdFind for Active Directory enumeration. They also attempted to remotely list running processes on systems using tasklist.exe and used PowerShell to execute commands for O365 manipulation.",
  "Persistence": "The threat actor established persistence through VPN access, the theft of browser cookies, and the creation of new O365 Service Principals with broad access permissions. They also used several layers of persistence utilizing both pre-existing and attacker-created Service Principals to gain global access to email.",
  "Privilege Escalation": "None",
  "Defense Evasion": "The threat actor used various techniques to evade detection, including the theft of browser cookies for bypassing multifactor authentication, the use of obfuscated and encrypted PowerShell scripts, and the masquerading of system names to match the victim's environment. They also attempted to manipulate the O365 environment using built-in Service Principals and impersonation roles.",
  "Credential Access": "The threat actor obtained credentials through domain replication protocols using the Get-ADReplAccount command from DSInternals, in-memory Mimikatz commands, and the abuse of the ApplicationImpersonation role. They also refreshed their credential set by performing credential theft activities in an already compromised environment.",
  "Discovery": "The threat actor accessed data from Information Repositories, added credentials to O365 Service Principals, and regularly interrogated other systems using tasklist.exe. They also probed external services in an attempt to regain access to the environment.",
  "Lateral Movement": "The campaign involved lateral movement activities such as VPN access, the theft of browser cookies for bypassing multifactor authentication, and the creation of new O365 Service Principals with broad access permissions. The threat actor also used several layers of persistence utilizing both pre-existing and attacker-created Service Principals to gain global access to email.",
  "Collection": "The threat actor accessed data from Information Repositories, added credentials to O365 Service Principals, and regularly interrogated other systems using tasklist.exe. They also probed external services in an attempt to regain access to the environment.",
  "Command and Control": "The threat actor manipulated the O365 environment using built-in Service Principals and impersonation roles, and attempted to remotely list running processes on systems using tasklist.exe. They also used PowerShell to execute commands for O365 manipulation.",
  "Exfiltration": "None",
  "Impact": "None",
  "Others": "The CTI report also includes details about the infrastructure, indicators of compromise, and additional resources related to the StellarParticle campaign. The threat actor's infrastructure, including C2 servers and additional resources, are detailed in the report, along with indicators of compromise such as SHA256 hashes and IP addresses."
