  "Reconnaissance": "None",
  "Resource Development": "None",
  "Initial Access": "In mid-October 2021, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts discovered an active ShadowPad backdoor that affected a number of industrial control systems in Pakistan, specifically engineering computers in building automation systems that are part of a telecom companyâs infrastructure. A further analysis of the attack revealed other organizations affected by it â manufacturing and telecommunications companies in Pakistan, a telecommunications company in Afghanistan, and a logistics and transport organization (a port) in Malaysia. Apparently, the wave of attacks uncovered by the experts began in March 2021. The attackers exploited a known vulnerability in MS Exchange, CVE-2021-26855, as the initial attack vector in several victim organizations. We do not have evidence that CVE-2021-26855 was exploited in all cases of attack identified, but we can assume that the attackers could use this particular vector to penetrate in other cases, as well.",
  "Execution": "The ShadowPad backdoor was downloaded to victim computers as the mscoree.dll file, which was launched by AppLaunch.exe â a perfectly legitimate application. Later the attackers launched ShadowPad using DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application (OleView). After the initial infection, the attackers first sent commands manually, then automatically. Additional tools used by the attackers include the CobaltStrike framework, the PlugX backdoor, BAT files for stealing credentials, web shells for remote access to the web server, and the Nextnet utility for scanning network hosts. The attackers used domains registered with NameSilo, GoDaddy.com, and ENOM to communicate with the command-and-control (C2) servers. Most of the C2 servers were hosted on dedicated servers rented from Choopa. The newly identified attacks on a variety of organizations had an almost totally unique set of TTPs, which leads us to believe that the same Chinese-speaking threat actor was behind all of these attacks.",
  "Persistence": "The attackers used the Windows Task Scheduler to create scheduled tasks for daily execution of malicious payloads. They also leveraged BITS jobs to download additional payloads and hijacked the execution flow using DLL side-loading. The attackers used attrib to change the permissions of the malicious files and the working directory to hide them.",
  "Privilege Escalation": "None",
  "Defense Evasion": "The attackers used BITS jobs to download additional payloads and employed deobfuscation and file and directory permissions modification to evade detection. They also hijacked the execution flow using DLL side-loading and hid artifacts using attrib. Additionally, they used standard encoding for data encoding and created internal and external proxies to operate within and outside the victim network.",
  "Credential Access": "None",
  "Discovery": "The attackers listed files and directories available on infected systems, scanned network hosts using the Nextnet utility, and queried the registry to get a history of connected USB devices.",
  "Lateral Movement": "None",
  "Collection": "The attackers used automated collection to collect a list of files and connected USB devices. They also collected data from the local system, including Office documents, and specifically exfiltrated .pst archives.",
  "Command and Control": "The attackers used web protocols to download additional tools, exfiltrate data, and operate the malware. They also encoded data using compression with a password, created internal and external proxies, and exfiltrated data to Google Drive.",
  "Exfiltration": "The attackers automatically exfiltrated Office documents and data over the C2 channel. They also exfiltrated data to Google Drive.",
  "Impact": "None",
  "Others": "The report also includes Yara rules, indicators of compromise, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping for the identified TTPs. The authors of the report are Artem Snegirev, Security Researcher, and Kirill Kruglov, Senior Research Developer, both from Kaspersky ICS CERT."
