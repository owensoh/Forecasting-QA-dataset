4: In 2021, Mandiant observed some threat actors deploying ransomware increasingly shift to exploiting vulnerabilities as an initial infection vector.
5: UNC2596, a threat actor that deploysCOLDDRAW ransomware, publicly known as Cuba Ransomware, exemplifies this trend.
6: While public reporting has highlighted CHANITOR campaigns as precursor for theseransomware incidents, Mandiant has also identified the exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, including ProxyShell and ProxyLogon, as another access point leveraged byUNC2596 likely as early as August 2021.
7: The content of this blog focuses on UNC2596 activity which has led to the deployment of COLDDRAW ransomware.
8: UNC2596 is currently the only threat actor tracked by Mandiant that uses COLDDRAW ransomware, which may suggest it’s exclusively used by the group.
9: During intrusions, thesethreat actors have used webshells to load the TERMITE in-memory dropper with subsequent activity involving multiple backdoors and built-in Windows utilities.
10: Beyondcommonplace tools, like Cobalt Strike BEACON and NetSupport, UNC2596 has used novel malware, including BURNTCIGAR to disable endpoint protection, WEDGECUT toenumerate active hosts, and the BUGHATCH custom downloader.
11: In incidents where COLDDRAW was deployed, UNC2596 used a multi-faceted extortion model where data is stolenand leaked on the group's shaming website, in addition to encryption using COLDDRAW ransomware.
12: COLDDRAW operations have impacted dozens of organizations across morethan ten countries, including those within critical infrastructure.
13: Victimology
14: The threat actors behind COLDDRAW ransomware attacks have not shied away from sensitive targets (Figure 1).
15: Their victims include utilities providers, government agencies, andorganizations that support non-profits and healthcare entities, however, we have not observed them attacking hospitals or entities that provide urgent care.
16: Around 80% of impactedvictim organizations are based in North America, but they have also impacted several countries in Europe as well as other regions (Figure 2).

20: Shaming Website
21: Figure 2: Alleged COLDDRAW victims by country
22: Since at least early 2021, COLDDRAW ransomware victims have been publicly extorted by the threat actors who threaten to publish or sell stolen data (Figure 3).
23: Each shaming postincludes information on the “date the files were received.” While the shaming site was not included in ransom notes until early 2021, one of the entries on the site states that the fileswere received in November 2019.
24: This is consistent with earliest samples uploaded to public malware repositories and may represent the earliest use of the ransomware.
25: Notably,while the data associated with most of the victims listed on this site are provided for free, there is a paid section which listed only a single victim at the time of publication.

27: Attack Lifecycle
28: Figure 3: Cuba (aka COLDDRAW) Ransomware Shaming Tor site (2021-12-31)
29: UNC2596 incidents that have led to COLDDRAW ransomware deployment have involved a mix of public and private tools, some of which are believed to be private to them.
30: The threatactors use several malware and utilities that are publicly available including NetSupport, Cobalt Strike BEACON, built-in Windows capabilities such as PsExec, RDP, and PowerShell,malware available for purchase such as WICKER, and exploits with publicly available proof-of-concept code.
31: UNC2596 also uses several tools and scripts that we have not observed inuse by other threat activity clusters to date, including BUGHATCH, BURNTCIGAR, WEDGECUT, and COLDDRAW.
32: See the “Notable Malware and Tools” section for additional detail.
33: Initial Reconnaissance / Initial Compromise
34: Mandiant has observed UNC2596 frequently leverage vulnerabilities affecting public-facing Microsoft Exchange infrastructure as an initial compromise vector in recent COLDDRAWintrusions s where the initial vector was identified.
35: The threat actors likely perform initial reconnaissance activities to identify Internet-facing systems that may be vulnerable toexploitation.
36: Establish Foothold
37: In COLDDRAW ransomware incidents, where initial access was gained via Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, UNC2596 subsequently deployed webshells to establish a foothold inthe victim network.
38: Mandiant has also observed these actors deploy a variety of backdoors to establish a foothold, including the publicly available NetSupport RAT, as well as BEACONand BUGHATCH, which have been deployed using the TERMITE in-memory dropper.
39: Escalate Privileges
40: (Ex)Change of Pace: UNC2596 Observed Leveraging Vulnerabilities to Deploy Cuba Ransomware | Mandiant
41: COLDDRAW ransomware incidents have mainly involved the use of credentials from valid accounts to escalate privileges.
42: In some cases, the source of these credentials is unknown,while in other cases, UNC2596 leveraged credential theft tools such as Mimikatz and WICKER.
43: We have also observed these threat actors manipulating or creating Windows accountsand modifying file access permissions.
44: In one intrusion, UNC2596 created a user account and added it to the administrator and RDP groups.
45: Internal Reconnaissance
46: UNC2596 has performed internal reconnaissance with the goals of identifying active network hosts that are candidates for encryption and identifying files to exfiltrate for use in theirmulti-faceted extortion scheme.
47: The threat actors have used WEDGECUT, a reconnaissance tool typically with the filename check.exe.
48: It identifies active hosts by sending PINGrequests to a list of hosts generated by a PowerShell script named comps2.ps1 which uses the Get-ADComputer cmdlet to enumerate the Active Directory.
49: The threat actors haveinteractively browsed file systems to identify files of interest.
50: Additionally, UNC2596 has routinely used a script named shar.bat to map all drives to network shares, which may assistin user file discovery (Figure 4).

74: Figure 4: UNC2596 used a batch script toenable sharing of all drives to facilitateencryption and data harvesting
75: (Ex)Change of Pace: UNC2596 Observed Leveraging Vulnerabilities to Deploy Cuba Ransomware | Mandiant
76: Move Laterally/Maintain Presence
77: During COLDDRAW incidents, UNC2596 actors have used several methods for lateral movement including RDP, SMB, and PsExec, frequently using BEACON to facilitate thismovement.
78: Following lateral movement, the threat actors deploy various backdoors including the publicly available NetSupport RAT, as well as BEACON and BUGHATCH, which areoften deployed using the TERMITE in-memory dropper.
79: These backdoors are sometimes executed using PowerShell launchers and have in some cases used predictable filenames.
80: Forexample, NetSupport-related scripts and executables observed during COLDDRAW incidents have typically used the filename ra or ra<#> whereas BUGHATCH scripts andexecutables have used the filename komar or komar<#>, followed by the appropriate extension.
81: Complete Mission
82: In order to complete their mission of multi-faceted extortion, the UNC2596 attempts to steal relevant user files and then identify and encrypt networked machines.
83: To facilitateencryption, and possibly to assist with collection efforts, the threat actors have used a batch script named shar.bat which maps each drive to a network share (Figure 4).
84: These newlycreated shares are then available for encryption by COLDDRAW.
85: During a more recent intrusion involving COLDDRAW, UNC2596 deployed the BURNTCIGAR utility using a batchscript named av.bat.
86: BURNTCIGAR is a utility first observed in November 2021 which terminates processes associated with endpoint security software to allow their ransomware andother tools to execute uninhibited.
87: UNC2596 has also been observed exfiltrating data prior to encrypting victim systems.
88: To date, we have not observed UNC2596 using any cloudstorage providers for data exfiltration; rather, they prefer to exfiltrate data to their BEACON infrastructure.
89: The threat actors then threaten to publish data of organizations that do notpay a ransom on their shaming site (Figure 5).

105: Notable Malware and Tools
106: (Ex)Change of Pace: UNC2596 Observed Leveraging Vulnerabilities to Deploy Cuba Ransomware | Mandiant
107: In addition to the use of publicly available malware and built-in utilities, Mandiant has observed UNC2596 use malware that is believed to be private to these threat actors, such asWEDGECUT, BUGHATCH, BURNTCIGAR, and COLDDRAW, or malware that is believed to be used by a limited number of threat actors, such as TERMITE.
108: WEDGECUT
109: WEDGECUT, which has been observed with the filename check.exe, is a reconnaissance tool that takes an argument containing a list of hosts or IP addresses and checks whether theyare online using ICMP packets.
110: This utility’s functionality is implemented using the IcmpCreateFile, IcmpSendEcho, and IcmpCloseFile APIs to send a buffer containing the string“Date Buffer”.
111: In practice, the list provided to WEDGECUT has been generated using a PowerShell script that enumerates the Active Directory using the Get-ADComputer cmdlet.
112: BUGHATCH
113: BUGHATCH is a downloader that executes arbitrary code on the compromised system downloaded from a C&C server.
114: The code sent by the C&C server includes PE files andPowerShell scripts.
115: BUGHATCH has been loaded in-memory by a dropper written in PowerShell or loaded by a PowerShell script from a remote URL.
116: BURNTCIGAR
117: BURNTCIGAR is a utility that terminates processes at the kernel level by exploiting an Avast driver’s undocumented IOCTL code (Table 1).
118: The malware terminates targeted processesusing the function DeviceIoControl to exploit the undocumented 0x9988C094 IOCTL code of the Avast driver, which calls ZwTerminateProcess with the given process identifier.
119: Wehave observed a batch script launcher that creates and starts a kernel service called aswSP_ArPot2 loading binary file C:\windows\temp\aswArPot.sys (legitimate Avast driver withSHA256 hash 4b5229b3250c8c08b98cb710d6c056144271de099a57ae09f5d2097fc41bd4f1).
120: To deploy BURNTCIGAR at a victim, the actor brings their own copy of the vulnerable Avast driver and installs it at a service.

232: Table 1: Processes Killed by BURNTCIGAR
233: (Ex)Change of Pace: UNC2596 Observed Leveraging Vulnerabilities to Deploy Cuba Ransomware | Mandiant
234: COLDDRAW is the name Mandiant uses to track the ransomware observed in Cuba Ransomware operations.
235: This ransomware appends the .cuba file extension to encrypted files.When executed, it terminates services associated with common server applications and encrypts files on the local filesystem and attached network drives using an embedded RSA key.Encrypted files are rewritten with a COLDDRAW-generated header prior to the encrypted file contents.
236: For large files, only the beginning and end of the file will be encrypted.
237: TERMITE
238: TERMITE is a password-protected memory-only dropper which contains an encrypted shellcode payload.
239: Observed payloads have included BEACON, METASPLOIT stager, orBUGHATCH.
240: TERMITE requires the actor to specify the ClearMyTracksByProcess export and supply a password as a command line option to operate successfully (Figure 6).Mandiant suspects that TERMITE may be available to multiple groups and is not exclusively used by UNC2596.
241: Rundll32.exe c:\windows\temp\komar.dll,ClearMyTracksByProcess 11985756
242: Figure 6: TERMITE command line execution
243: Tracking TERMITE
244: During UNC2596 intrusions involving COLDDRAW, the actors load tools and malware from web accessible systems that were also typically used for BEACON.
245: Over a period ofapproximately six months, Mandiant Advanced Practices tracked a TERMITE loader at hxxp://45.32.229[.
246: ]66/new.dll which used the password 11985756 to decode various BEACONpayloads.
247: Ongoing analysis of TERMITE payloads collected during this timeframe showed that TERMITE underwent modifications to evade detections.
248: UNC2596 also began using theTERMITE password 11985757 in October 2021.
249: CHANITOR Overlaps
250: Mandiant has not responded to any intrusions where we have directly observed CHANITOR malware lead to COLDDRAW ransomware; however, we have identified overlaps betweenCHANITOR-related operations and COLDDRAW incidents.
251: These include infrastructure overlaps, common code signing certificates, use of a shared packer, and naming similaritiesfor domains, files, and URL paths, among others.
252: The code signing certificate with the Common Name FDFWJTORFQVNXQHFAH has been used to sign COLDDRAW payloads, as well as SENDSAFE payloads distributed byCHANITOR.
253: Mandiant has not observed the certificate used by other threat actors.COLDDRAW payloads and SENDSAFE payloads distributed by CHANITOR have used a shared packer that we refer to as LONGFALL.
254: LONGFALL, which is also known asCryptOne, has been used with a variety of malware families.The WICKER stealer has been used in both CHANITOR-related post-exploitation activity and COLDDRAW incidents, including samples sharing the same command and control(C&C) server.Payloads distributed through CHANITOR and payloads identified in COLDDRAW ransomware incidents have masqueraded as the same legitimate applications includingmDNSResponder and Java.Public reporting has also highlighted some overlaps between COLDDRAW and ZEPPELIN, another ransomware that has reportedly been distributed via CHANITOR.
255: Implications
256: (Ex)Change of Pace: UNC2596 Observed Leveraging Vulnerabilities to Deploy Cuba Ransomware | Mandiant
257: As the number of vulnerabilities identified and publicly disclosed continues to increase year after year, Mandiant has also observed an increase in the use of vulnerabilities as an initialcompromise vector by ransomware threat actors including utilizing both zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities in their activity; notable examples include UNC2447 and FIN11.
258: Shiftingtowards vulnerabilities for initial access could offer threat actors more accurate targeting and higher success rates when compared to malicious email campaigns, which rely more onuncontrollable factors, such as victims’ interacting with malicious links or documents.
259: The rise in zero-day usage specifically could be reflective of significant funds and resources at thedisposal of ransomware operators, which are being directed towards exploit research and development or the purchasing of exploits from trusted brokers.
260: However, threat actors donot have to use zero-days to be effective.
261: A subset of n-day vulnerabilities are often considered attractive targets for threat actors due to their impact of publicly exposed products,ability to facilitate code execution after successful exploitation, and the availability of significant technical details and/or exploit code in public venues.
262: As the number of vulnerabilitiespublicly disclosed continues to rise, we anticipate threat actors, including ransomware operators, to continue to exploit vulnerabilities in their operations.
