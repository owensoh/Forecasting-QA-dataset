  "Reconnaissance": "Mandiant has observed UNC2596 frequently leverage vulnerabilities affecting public-facing Microsoft Exchange infrastructure as an initial compromise vector in recent COLDDRAW intrusions where the initial vector was identified. The threat actors likely perform initial reconnaissance activities to identify Internet-facing systems that may be vulnerable to exploitation.",
  "Resource Development": "UNC2596 incidents that have led to COLDDRAW ransomware deployment have involved a mix of public and private tools, some of which are believed to be private to them. The threat actors use several malware and utilities that are publicly available including NetSupport, Cobalt Strike BEACON, built-in Windows capabilities such as PsExec, RDP, and PowerShell, malware available for purchase such as WICKER, and exploits with publicly available proof-of-concept code. UNC2596 also uses several tools and scripts that have not been observed in use by other threat activity clusters to date, including BUGHATCH, BURNTCIGAR, WEDGECUT, and COLDDRAW.",
  "Initial Access": "In COLDDRAW ransomware incidents, where initial access was gained via Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, UNC2596 subsequently deployed webshells to establish a foothold in the victim network. Mandiant has also observed these actors deploy a variety of backdoors to establish a foothold, including the publicly available NetSupport RAT, as well as BEACON and BUGHATCH, which have been deployed using the TERMITE in-memory dropper.",
  "Execution": "COLDDRAW ransomware incidents have mainly involved the use of credentials from valid accounts to escalate privileges. In some cases, the source of these credentials is unknown, while in other cases, UNC2596 leveraged credential theft tools such as Mimikatz and WICKER. We have also observed these threat actors manipulating or creating Windows accounts and modifying file access permissions. In one intrusion, UNC2596 created a user account and added it to the administrator and RDP groups.",
  "Persistence": "UNC2596 has performed internal reconnaissance with the goals of identifying active network hosts that are candidates for encryption and identifying files to exfiltrate for use in their multi-faceted extortion scheme. The threat actors have used WEDGECUT, a reconnaissance tool typically with the filename check.exe. It identifies active hosts by sending PING requests to a list of hosts generated by a PowerShell script named comps2.ps1 which uses the Get-ADComputer cmdlet to enumerate the Active Directory. The threat actors have interactively browsed file systems to identify files of interest. Additionally, UNC2596 has routinely used a script named shar.bat to map all drives to network shares, which may assist in user file discovery.",
  "Privilege Escalation": "COLDDRAW ransomware incidents have mainly involved the use of credentials from valid accounts to escalate privileges.

In one intrusion, UNC2596 created a user account and added it to the administrator and RDP groups.",
  "Defense Evasion": "In addition to the use of publicly available malware and built-in utilities, Mandiant has observed UNC2596 use malware that is believed to be private to these threat actors, such as WEDGECUT, BUGHATCH, BURNTCIGAR, and COLDDRAW, or malware that is believed to be used by a limited number of threat actors, such as TERMITE.",
  "Credential Access": "UNC2596 incidents that have led to COLDDRAW ransomware deployment have involved a mix of public and private tools, some of which are believed to be private to them.

Additionally, UNC2596 has routinely used a script named shar.bat to map all drives to network shares, which may assist in user file discovery.",
  "Lateral Movement": "During COLDDRAW incidents, UNC2596 actors have used several methods for lateral movement including RDP, SMB, and PsExec, frequently using BEACON to facilitate this movement. Following lateral movement, the threat actors deploy various backdoors including the publicly available NetSupport RAT, as well as BEACON and BUGHATCH, which are often deployed using the TERMITE in-memory dropper. These backdoors are sometimes executed using PowerShell launchers and have in some cases used predictable filenames. For example, NetSupport-related scripts and executables observed during COLDDRAW incidents have typically used the filename ra or ra<#> whereas BUGHATCH scripts and executables have used the filename komar or komar<#>, followed by the appropriate extension.",
  "Collection": "In order to complete their mission of multi-faceted extortion, the UNC2596 attempts to steal relevant user files and then identify and encrypt networked machines. To facilitate encryption, and possibly to assist with collection efforts, the threat actors have used a batch script named shar.bat which maps each drive to a network share. These newly created shares are then available for encryption by COLDDRAW. During a more recent intrusion involving COLDDRAW, UNC2596 deployed the BURNTCIGAR utility using a batch script named av.bat. BURNTCIGAR is a utility first observed in November 2021 which terminates processes associated with endpoint security software to allow their ransomware and other tools to execute uninhibited. UNC2596 has also been observed exfiltrating data prior to encrypting victim systems. To date, we have not observed UNC2596 using any cloud storage providers for data exfiltration; rather, they prefer to exfiltrate data to their BEACON infrastructure. The threat actors then threaten to publish data of organizations that do not pay a ransom on their shaming site.",

  "Others": "Mandiant has observed an increase in the use of vulnerabilities as an initial compromise vector by ransomware threat actors including utilizing both zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities in their activity; notable examples include UNC2447 and FIN11. Shifting towards vulnerabilities for initial access could offer threat actors more accurate targeting and higher success rates when compared to malicious email campaigns, which rely more on uncontrollable factors, such as victimsâ interacting with malicious links or documents. The rise in zero-day usage specifically could be reflective of significant funds and resources at the disposal of ransomware operators, which are being directed towards exploit research and development or the purchasing of exploits from trusted brokers. However, threat actors do not have to use zero-days to be effective. A subset of n-day vulnerabilities are often considered attractive targets for threat actors due to their impact of publicly exposed products, ability to facilitate code execution after successful exploitation, and the availability of significant technical details and/or exploit code in public venues. As the number of vulnerabilities publicly disclosed continues to rise, we anticipate threat actors, including ransomware operators, to continue to exploit vulnerabilities in their operations."
