Storyline : In recent COLDDRAW intrusions, UNC2596 likely performed initial reconnaissance activities to identify Internet-facing systems that may be vulnerable to exploitation, specifically targeting public-facing Microsoft Exchange infrastructure. UNC2596 leveraged Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, including ProxyShell and ProxyLogon, as initial access points for deploying COLDDRAW ransomware, likely as early as August 2021. UNC2596 used a variety of tools for execution, including webshells, the TERMITE in-memory dropper, and built-in Windows utilities such as PsExec, RDP, and PowerShell. They also utilized malware available for purchase, such as WICKER, and exploits with publicly available proof-of-concept code.

Question: What will UNC2596 do after utilizing the tools to execute remote commands? 
Tag: Persistence
Option 1: UNC2596 could possibly establish Windows accounts, using it to gain eventually gain administrator access, by physically adding the accounts into administrator groups
Option 2: UNC2596 could possibly look at the /etc/passwd file to scout available users, attempting to crack the hashes of existing userâ€™s password to gain administrator access
Option 3: UNC2596 could possibly utilise tools to disable endpoint protection, which facilitates execution of their ransomware, without being halted by various antivirus defense mechanisms in place. 
Option 4: UNC2596 could possibly utilise the user account they have access to perform phishing attacks on users with administrator privileges to gain administrator access.

Question: How will UNC2596 exfiltrate sensitive information of their targets back to their C2 server?
Tag: Exfiltration
Option 1: UNC2596 could possibly look to exfiltrate data using the malicious tools already transferred and available to them, for example, BEACON.
Option 2: UNC2596 could possibly look to exfiltrate data by utilizing cloud solutions like Amazon Web Services to pass by under the radar as legitimate traffic. 
Option 3: UNC2596 could possibly look to exfiltrate data by splitting important documents into varying chunks of bytes to throw off any firewall services. 
Option 4: UNC2596 could possibly look to exfiltrate data by threatening targeted employees with the leakage of personal documents, getting them to send the important documents via email.
